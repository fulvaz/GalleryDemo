It is a startup project to use gulp + browser-sync, and complie sass files automatically if any watched files edited.

To get start, you might need to change the value of  'host' attribute of gulpfile.js

PS: for my own convenient, i also pushed the node_module to the project, plz feel free to delete the node_module dir : )

have fun
